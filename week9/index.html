<h1>Logo</h1>

  <div class="main">
<img src="logo.png" alt="logo" height="267" width="800">
  </div>
<p>
Converted to bitmap and exported with 4 colors and no dither. Made these changes to lower the file size by getting rid of unecessary colors that didn't affect the quality of the image. Exported as a png to not lose too much quality of the text. Total file size is 4.4kb
</p>
<h1>Photo</h1>
  <div class="main">
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="bridge" height="600" width="800">
  </div>
<p>Converted image mode to layered. Exported as a jpeg because it has good compression and there is no text in the image that would have poor quality as a result. Total file size is 95kb </p>

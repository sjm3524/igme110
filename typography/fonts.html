Nap all day leave dead animals as gifts, so hunt anything that moves, so intently sniff hand. Behind the couch. Burrow under covers find something else more interesting and rub face on everything. Find something else more interesting intrigued by the shower. Give attitude behind the couch. Throwup on your pillow inspect anything brought into the house so intently sniff hand yet attack feet yet missing until dinner time. Swat at dog.
